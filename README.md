This app is a practice React app. The idea for the app came from my experience playing college hockey. As the third, and sometimes fourth, string goalie on my team, I didn't see the ice very often or even get dressed as the backup. I often found myself on Friday and Saturday evenings sitting in the stands in a cheap suit taking stats with the rest of the scratches for that days game. 

Our coaches wanted us to take a handful of different stats. I would usually grab the 'shots' stat form. It was just a picture of a rink on printer paper. When shots where taken you would use your pencil to mark a small dot where the shot was taken on the ice on the corresponding place on the paper. It was pretty easy to fudge. Coach didnâ€™t really look at the stats anyways. 

But if he did, he might have more questions. Who took what shot, was it on net or did it miss? Where did we score from? Maybe he would want historical data. Maybe he would want to see who had the most shots on net. 

This app would provide a gateway to unlocking more valuable data. While it is not wired up to connect to a database API, the front-end functionality would hopefully make life easier for the game day scratches than having make marks on a piece of paper with a broken pencil.
